**IMPORTANT THINGS**

  This static application was created in 29 hours, with great ambition and unhealthy amounts of coffee, 
  I would like you to give me as much feedback as possible, 
  taking into account the development time and that it's 3am and I'm finishing adding extra things to the ones requested by the work :)

**CONTAINS**

  This app is created entirely in React, using react-router-dom for SPA navigation, 
  boostrapp 5 for styling and responsive app, it contains a Landing page for a Mazda CX-5 van, 
  a page describing the technical details of the van and a payment page, plus a thank you page and a 404 not found page.

  The packer used was VITE, looking for speed and consistency.

**FINAL THINGS**

  After cloning the local repository, don't forget to go into the "frontend" folder and install the dependencies

    $ cd frontend
    $ npm install
    $ npm start

  Thanks teacher :)
